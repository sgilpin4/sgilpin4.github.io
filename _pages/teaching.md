Philosophy of Teaching and Learning
======
On the surface, my role as an instructor is to teach my students mathematics and how to use these tools in their own disciples. Deeper down, my goal is to instill in my students the desire to think critically and strive to understand why first, then how. There is more to mathematics than computing derivaties or implementing optimization schemes, and I want my students to walk away from my classes appreciating the breadth of understanding mathematics gives us and the ability to critically think and problemsolve in their own fields.


Professional Development
======
In order to succeed as an effective instructor, I am always seeking out ways to learn and grow as a teacher. This includes participating in various professional development workshops and seminars on teaching.

Certificate in College Teaching, August 2022, University of Colorado, Boulder
------
The [Certificate in College Teaching (CCT)](https://www.colorado.edu/center/teaching-learning/programs/graduate-certificates/certificate-college-teaching) is a graduate certificate given by the Center for Teaching and Learning. The certificate requires teaching at least two semesters, participation in several professional development workshops, peer and instructor evaluations, and submitting a teaching portfolio. 

Transforming Your Research Into Teaching (TYRIT), Summer 2022, University of Colorado, Boulder
------
This seven week workshop series offered through the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) network explored how to create a class from the ground up using participant's PhD or postdoc research as the material for the course. For this workshop series, I developed a graduate level elective course on hyperbolic partial differential equations.

Center for Teaching and Learning Lead, Summer 2020-Spring 2021, University of Colorado, Boulder
------
I participated as one of two Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) Lead Teaching Assistants for the Applied Math department. As Lead, I served as a resource for Teaching Assistants in our department for the 2020-2021 academic year, which included running the Teaching Excellence course in Fall 2020, observing classes, and providing video teaching consultations. Also as Lead, I continued professional development through the CTL.
