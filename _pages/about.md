Research Interests
======
I believe mathematics is its most beautiful when it can be used to understand the world around us, which is why I use mathematics as a tool to study problems related to atmospheric and ocean science. My current research focuses on covariances governed by hyperbolic partial differential equations. By studying these dynamics in both the continuum and discrete spaces, we gain a better understanding of how covariances evolve in space in time. This work is highly relevant to applications such as data assimilation and geophysical systems involving advective dynamics. 

My overall research goal is to use mathematics to study problems in data assimilation and geoscience in an effort to further our understanding and develop practical solutions.
