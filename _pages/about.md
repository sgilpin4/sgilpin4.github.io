Mathematics is the foundation of all science and is a powerful tool to describe the world around us.

Research Interests
======
I believe mathematics is its most beautiful when it can be used to understand the world around us, which is why I use mathematics as a tool to study problems within atmosphere and ocean science. My current research focuses on dynamics in the context of data assimilation, particularly covariance dynamics associated with states governed by hyperbolic partial differential equations (the continuity equation, for example). Using tools from partial differential equations, functional analysis, statistics, and numerics, we can obtain a fundamental understanding of covariance evolution, which is an integral part of data assimilation algorithms.
