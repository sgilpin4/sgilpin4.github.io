Covariance Dynamics in Data Assimilation 
======
Uncertainty quantification, particularly the covariance, is crucial for numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and there are still parts of how the covariance evolves in time that we don’t fully understand. My research looks at this covariance propagation, studying the mathematical equations that describe its time evolution and how we solve these equations during data assimilation. By taking a fundamental look at these equations, I am seeking a better understanding of behaviors observed in current NWP models, such as variance loss, to improve our ability to more accurately forecast weather and provide better preparedness for severe weather events. This research involves different areas of mathematics: statistics, functional analysis, partial differential equations, and numerical analysis.


Radio Occultation
======
Radio occultation (RO) is a method of remote-sensing used to observe Earth's atmosphere. As radio waves emitted from GPS satellites traverse quasi-horiztontally through our atmosphere, they ``occult", or bend, depending on the atmospheric state. Low-Earth orbiting (LEO) satellites then receive these radiowave signals, which can ultimately produce vertical profiles of temperature and water vapor pressure in the lower atmosphere and electron density in the ionosphere. RO observations are assimilated into numerical weather prediction and have been shown to make a significant impact.

While working for the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) group and UCAR, I worked on small projects with the aim of improving co-locations methods for RO-radiosonde comparisons and investiagating the errors introduced during vertical interpolation of bending angles during RO data assimilation.
